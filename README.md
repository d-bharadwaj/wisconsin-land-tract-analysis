# Wisconisin Land Tract Analysis
## Overview  
The objective is to make predictions about census data for Wisconsin using regression models. We'll need to extract data from four files to construct DataFrames suitable for training during this project:

`counties.geojson` - population and boundaries of each county in Wisconsin <br>
`tracts.shp` - boundaries of each census tract (counties are subdivided into tracts) <br>
`counties_tracts.db` - details about housing units per tract <br>
`land.zip` - details about land use (farm, forest, developed, etc.) <br>

At the end we compare the different models that were developed for this project.s
